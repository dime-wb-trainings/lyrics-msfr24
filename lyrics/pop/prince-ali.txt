Make way for Prince Ali
Say hey, it's Prince Ali
Hey! Clear the way in the old Bazaar
Hey you, let us through it's a brand-new star
Oh, come be the first on your block to meet his eye
Make way, here he comes
Ring bells, bang the drums
You're gonna love this guy
Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa
Show some respect, boy, genuflect, down on one knee
Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your Friday salaam
Then come and meet his spectacular coterie
Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa
Strong as ten regular men, definitely
He's faced the galloping hordes
A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords? Why, Prince Ali
Fellas, he's got
(He's got 75 golden camels)
Uh-huh, now the ladies, what he got?
(Purple peacocks, he's got 53)
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
When it comes to exotic-type mammals
Everybody help me out
He's got a zoo? I'm telling you,
It's a world-class menagerie
Prince Ali, handsome is he, Ali Ababwa
That physique! How can I speak?
Weak at my knees! You yummy boy
So get on out in that square
Adjust your veil and prepare
To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali, oops
He's got 95 white Persian monkeys
(He's got the monkeys, a bunch of monkeys)
And to view them he charges no fee
(He's generous, so generous)
He's got ten thousand servants and flunkies
(Proud to work for him)
They bow to his whim, love serving him
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali
Prince Ali
Prince A...
We're waiting for you!
We're not going until you go
You can do it
There it is
Prince Ali, amorous he, Ali Ababwa
Heard your princess was hot! Where is she?
And that, good people, is why
He got all cute and dropped by
With 60 elephants, llamas galore (for real?)
With his bears and lions, a brass band and more (what?)
With his 40 fakirs, his cooks, his bakers
His birds that warble on key
Make way for Prince Ali
