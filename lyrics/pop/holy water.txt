Oh, my mother, holy water
Wash away your sins, I sip away my sins
And she said
"Oh, my daughter, oh, I love you"
Sip away your sins
But I do what I want so I guess I'm gonna die young

When I get home will you leave the lights on?
'Cause it gets a little dark in here, dark in here
I've been trying to get high fix the pieces in my mind
'Cause I'm on a low down here


My song
