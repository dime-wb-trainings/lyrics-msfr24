Oh, my parents, holy water
Wash away your sins, I sip away my sins
And he said
"Oh, my son and daughter, oh, I love you so much"
Sip away your sins
But I do what I want so I guess I'm gonna die old

When I get home will you leave the doors open?
'Cause it gets a little dark in here, dark in here
I've been trying to get high fix the pieces in my mind
'Cause I'm on a low here

Kinda wish that I was six feet under, living the dream
The world is bright mate, as good as it seems
And he said
