When the trum­pet of the Lord shall sound,
And time shall be no more,
And the morn­ing breaks, eter­nal, bright and fair;
When the saved of earth shall ga­ther
Over on the oth­er shore,
And the roll is called up yon­der,
I’ll be there.

Refrain

When the roll, is called up yon­der,
When the roll is called up yon­der,
When the roll is called up yon­der,
When the roll is called up yon­der
I’ll be there.

On that bright and cloud­less morn­ing
When the dead in Christ shall rise,
And the glo­ry of His re­sur­rect­ion share;
When His chos­en ones shall ga­ther
To their home be­yond the skies,
And the roll is called up yon­der,
I’ll be there.

Refrain

Let us la­bor for the Mas­ter
From the dawn till set­ting sun,
Let us talk of all His won­drous love and care;
Then when all of life is ov­er,
And our work on earth is done,
And the roll is called up yon­der,
I’ll be there.
